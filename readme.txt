Lore:
Endless Knight is a wave based zombie survival game. A group of scientists have uncovered the grave of a necromancer, 
who plots to take over the world. You play as a lone hero determined to save the world, not just because it is right, 
but also because he lives on the planet.

Controls:
WASD to move, Q and E to swap weapons, R to reload.
Shopping has its own controls, with 1, 2, 3, and 4 all buying different guns, F to buy a medkit, and X to leave.

Cheats:
K to kill al enemies, N to launch next wave, M to go to the next map, and Z to open the shop.

Enemy types:
Mobs are basic zombies, and are the baseline the rest are compared to. Difficulty of 3.
Kobolds are small, fast, and spawn more often than mobs, as they take less points to spawn. Difficulty of 1.5.
Spectres have the same stats as Mob, but move through walls. They are rarer than mobs. Difficulty of 5.
Tanks are the rarest monster, are slow, but have a lot of health. Difficulty of 8.

Spawning:
Each wave has a difficulty of 4 * the current wave, and each monster takes their difficulty away from the difficulty int.
They also have minimum difficulty they can spawn at. This way the player doesn't get swarmed by Tanks the first time they
can be seen.
